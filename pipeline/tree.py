"""Generate tree.json (the biocViews category hierarchy) from real origins.

tree.json drives the package category browser. The legacy build produced it from
VIEWS via the biocViews R package; this builds it from two genuine origins:

  the vocabulary   Bioconductor/biocViews, inst/dot/biocViewsVocab.dot — the
                   editable source of the term hierarchy (a DAG, not a tree:
                   a term may have several parents)
  the assignments  each package's biocViews field in packages.json

Output format is what the jsTree widget expects, and it is not uniform:

  term with packages     {"data": "Name (n)", "attr": {"packageList": "a,b,c",
                                                       "id": "Name"}, "children": [...]}
  term with none         {"data": "Name", "childnum": 0, "children": [...]}

The two package figures on a node are different sets, which is the easy mistake:
`packageList` holds packages filed DIRECTLY under the term, while the count in
`data` is CUMULATIVE over the subtree. AssayDomain renders "AssayDomain (960)"
while carrying 13 packages. Terms with no direct assignments but populated
descendants fall back to the cumulative set (ChipManufacturer, ChipName).

The vocabulary is pinned per release: terms are added over time, so devel's list
against an older release invents categories that did not exist then.

biocViews.json is deliberately not generated: nothing reads it, and its own
source in get_json.rb is marked "todo - remove this".

Usage:
    ./build-tree-json.py --bioc 3.23 --json-dir astro/data --out /tmp/tree.json
